\chapter{Blow count}\label{sec_1}

The predicted blow count as function of penetration depth for continuous driving
are shown in Figure ~\ref{blow_count_BE} and ~\ref{blow_count_UB} for BE and UB conditions, respectively. The energy loss in the conical section is modelled by reducing the applied efficiency. Hence, the applied efficiency is reduced for the last part of pile driving.
