\chapter{Time series of forces and acceleration for structural analyses}\label{sec_1}

Time series of forces and accelerations in the pile after a hammer blow are presented in Figure 
 ~\ref{Time_Acc} and Figure ~\ref{Time_Force}. The time series are extracted at
different distances from the pile head representing the support brackets for the Air Tight Platform (ATP), and the upper and lower support for the boat landing. 
The time series are presented for 3 different pile penetration depths.
